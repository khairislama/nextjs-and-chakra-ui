# :rocket:Next Js & Chakra UI & typescript✨

## _:star:This project is inspired by the complete Chakra UI official tutorial:star:_

## Before Getting Started :exclamation:

This is a complete code base created by me to easily refresh our memory in using Chakra UI :gift_heart: with Next JS :sparkler: and how we can easly Override the built-in Component's Styles and Variants :full_moon_with_face:

- Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks
- Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of React
- ✨The Magic of Css in Js ✨
